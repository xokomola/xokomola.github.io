Alex Chen is a systems programmer who fell in love with Rust after years of wrestling with C++ memory bugs. Currently working as a Staff Engineer at a major tech company, Alex has been instrumental in migrating critical infrastructure to Rust, resulting in significant performance improvements and zero memory safety incidents.

With a background in computer science from Stanford and experience at companies like Mozilla and Microsoft, Alex has contributed to major open-source projects including the Rust compiler, Firefox's Servo engine, and various system libraries. They're particularly passionate about making systems programming more accessible and teaching others about memory safety.

Alex is also an active member of the Rust community, organizing local meetups and mentoring newcomers to the language. When not coding, they enjoy rock climbing and brewing craft beer, finding that both activities require the same kind of careful attention to detail that good systems programming demands.
