Dr. Elena Rodriguez is a mathematician and computational artist whose work bridges the gap between pure mathematics and visual expression. With a PhD in Applied Mathematics from the University of Barcelona and postdoctoral research at MIT, Elena has spent over 15 years exploring the mathematical beauty hidden in natural phenomena.

Her research focuses on fractal geometry, chaos theory, and the mathematical patterns that appear throughout nature—from the branching of trees to the formation of coastlines. Elena's computational art has been exhibited in galleries worldwide, and her mathematical visualizations have been featured in scientific publications and educational materials.

Elena is also passionate about making mathematics more accessible and beautiful. She regularly gives talks at schools and universities, showing students that math isn't just about numbers—it's about discovering the hidden patterns that make our world so fascinating. When not working on equations, Elena enjoys hiking in the Pyrenees, finding mathematical patterns in the natural world around her.
