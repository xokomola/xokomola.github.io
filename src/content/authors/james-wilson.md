Dr. James Wilson is a computer science professor at the University of Edinburgh and a passionate advocate for functional programming. With over 20 years of experience in programming language research and education, James has helped shape the way we think about software development, particularly in the areas of type systems, concurrency, and program correctness.

His research focuses on making functional programming more accessible and practical for everyday software development. James has contributed to several programming language implementations and has published extensively on topics ranging from type theory to software engineering practices. He's particularly interested in how functional programming principles can help developers write more reliable, maintainable code.

James is also a dedicated educator who believes that good programming is as much about thinking clearly as it is about writing code. His courses on functional programming are among the most popular at the university, and he regularly gives workshops and talks at conferences worldwide. When not teaching or researching, James enjoys playing traditional Scottish music on the fiddle and hiking in the Highlands.
